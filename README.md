# shroomery

Shroomery is an environment management platform for growing (culinary) mushrooms.
The goal is to automate managing the temperature, humidity, and light of a mushroom
grow box or tent (and maybe one day room, if I end up cooking way more mushrooms than I think).

## Features

Current:

- None, all work in progress

Intended:

- Measure temperature
- Measure humidity
- Measure light
- Use a humidifier and dehumidifier to modify humidity
- Use a heater and cooler to modify temperature
- Use a lightbulb or LED strip to modify light
- Create profiles for different mushrooms that store which settings are optimal for that mushroom
